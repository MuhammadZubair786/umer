They really found the right people for the roles of all the characters. The plot is super unique, the scenes are thrilling, the character development is amazing, and I cannot stop watching.

                    Millie Bobby Brown (one of my idols) made Eleven come to life. Even though her character doesn't have a lot of dialouge, you can tell what she's feeling, just from her facial expressions. Noah Schnapp is by far one of the best teen stars I've ever watched. His acting is magnificent! Finn Wolfhard is super talented aswell. I used to only know him from It, but looking at his acting in Stranger Things, is amazing! Sadie Sink is amazing. Her character Max, is super sassy and smart-mouthed, and I love it! Gaten Matarazzo's character Dustin, is totally adorable. He's definietly one of the most hilarious characters. Caleb McLaughlin's Lucas, is also some super talented acting! He's definietly an underatted character. Winona Ryder (my idol, literally), her acting is so authentic and genuine, it seems as if she isn't even acting at all!
                    My only problem with Stranger Things, is the third season. It was still amazing, don't get me wrong, but it seemed a little hard to follow at times. Season one and season two, were totally the better ones in the TV show, but then again, everything in this show is beyond amazing. The Duffer Brothers are doing a great job, with all the connections, and character development, etc
                    I will DEFINIETLY be coming back for Season 4! (i'm so excited omg ahgah). I feel like Season 4 should be the last season, because I feel like the show might get a little repetitive, and some of the 'kids' are turning older, and kinda out growing their roles! Anyways, LOVE. THIS. SHOW. <br><br><br></td>
